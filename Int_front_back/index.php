      <h3> What is Astral ?</h3>
      <p class="parag">  During the recent hackathon event involving teams WAD, WEB, GAME, and ASR, we embarked on an exciting journey over two and a half days. Astral is a game where we draw a tarot card to glimpse into our future. It's an immersive experience that not only tests our technical skills but also adds a touch of mysticism to the world of coding and development. As we delved into this unique project, we explored the intersection of technology and fortune-telling, and the result was a captivating blend of creativity and innovation."  </p>
